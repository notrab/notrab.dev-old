# Now

Over the last few years I've been working closely with a lot of companies embracing headless commerce, headless APIs, and the Jamstack.

I'm currently working with [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com) in Developer Relations. I spend most of my days writing documentation, speaking with customers, maintaining SDKs, tutorials, guides, and working with the community.

When I'm not working, you'll find me downtown [Verdansk](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Verdansk).
